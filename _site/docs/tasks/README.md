# Tasks

The Task system is one of the key aspects of World of Workflows and is commonly the only part of the platform your Users will see. It consists of two main areas:

## The Task Queue
The task queue is a place where all the available tasks for an end user are displayed. This is filtered by the Users' capabilities and ensures they only see tasks configured for staff with their capabilities. Users **pick** tasks from the task queue to enter their own to-do list and proceed to work through their to-do list.

## The Task Pane
The Task Pane shows the details of a task and has 6 main areas:

- Title
- Description
- Data Entry
- Default Actions
- Custom Actions
- Additional Information

## Working with Tasks
End users are expected to use the task system as an advanced to-do list. They pick tasks from the task queue and work through them. The task pane shows the details of the task and allows them to enter data and perform actions.
