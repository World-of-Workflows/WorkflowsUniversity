# Task Administration

This section describes how you, as a workflow author can work with tasks to make and deliver meaningful results for end users.

For information on how to use tasks, click [here](../tasks/README.md)

Tasks are created during workflows and are used to deliver information to end users. They are the primary way that end users interact with the system. Tasks are created using the following activities:

- **Simple Task Create and Wait** - Created a new task and wait until the end-user has responded to a specific question.
- **Task Create and Wait** - Creates a standard task and waits until the end user completes the task or marks it as an error.
- **Task Detail Create** - Allows you to modify an existing task

Tasks consist of the following parts:

- **Id** - A unique identifier for the task. This is generated automatically and is not editable.
- **Title** - The title of the task. This is displayed in the task queue and the task pane. It can be created as static text, or dynamically created using liquid or JavaScript.
