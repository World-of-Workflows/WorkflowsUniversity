The automation of work is the process of using technology to perform tasks that were previously done by humans. This trend has been accelerating in recent years, with advances in artificial intelligence and robotics making it possible to automate a wide range of jobs. Automation can increase efficiency and productivity, but it can also lead to job losses and other economic disruptions. Some people are concerned about the impact of automation on the workforce, while others see it as a natural evolution of the economy. Despite the potential challenges, the automation of work is likely to continue as companies seek to improve their operations and compete in a global market.

- **Tasks** As few processes can be *totally* automated, the task system allows you to configure the system to instruct your team to perform exactly the right task when it is needs.
- **Views** allow you to show the team just the information they need and allows them to navigate quickly and easily through business data.
- **Plugins** allow you to extend the system with additional workflow activities and integrate with other systems.
