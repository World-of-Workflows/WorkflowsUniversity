The automation of work is the process of using technology to perform tasks that were previously done by humans. This trend has been accelerating in recent years, with advances in artificial intelligence and robotics making it possible to automate a wide range of jobs. Automation can increase efficiency and productivity, but it can also lead to job losses and other economic disruptions. Some people are concerned about the impact of automation on the workforce, while others see it as a natural evolution of the economy. Despite the potential challenges, the automation of work is likely to continue as companies seek to improve their operations and compete in a global market.

**World of Workflows** is designed to assist small and medium-sized businesses in automating their work processes. It provides a rich set of tools and features that can be used to design and implement workflows that automate a variety of tasks. The system is designed to be easy to use and requires no programming knowledge. It can be used to automate a wide range of tasks, including:

- Sending emails
- Employee Onboarding and offboarding
- Sales Processes
- Returns Processes
- Automated Fundraising

and much much more.

This training course is designed to provide you with a thorough understanding of the features and capabilities of the software, as well as best practices for using it to streamline your business processes and improve efficiency. You'll learn how to set up and configure the software, manage users and permissions, and use its powerful tools to automate a variety of tasks. By the end of this course, you'll have the knowledge and skills you need to use the software to its full potential and help your business thrive. 

Let's get started.

# The product
**World of Workflows** is a web-based application that can run both in the cloud (for your company) using a subscription model or on your computer (for a single user) for free.

We're making the single-user version free to enable people to learn **World of Workflows** but also for those looking to design data structures, views, and workflows without having to pay for a subscription.

**World of Workflows** runs **solutions**, which are a configuration of the platform to solve one or more business tasks.

# The platform
**World of Workflows** is written in Microsoft's **.Net 7**.

# Components
**World of Workflows** consists of several components which work together to automate your business processes:

- **Workflows** are the core of the system and allow you to graphically design your workflows as flowcharts and the system will then be automated based on your instructions.
- **The Database** allows you to store information about your business and the system will then allow you to query and update this information. It can also be used to integrate multiple systems.
- **Tasks** As few processes can be *totally* automated, the task system allows you to configure the system to instruct your team to perform exactly the right task when it is needed.
- **Views** allow you to show the team just the information they need and allows them to navigate quickly and easily through business data.
- **Plugins** allow you to extend the system with additional workflow activities and integrate with other systems.
- **API** our API allows 3rd party systems to easily integrate with **World of Workflows**.
- **Solutions** are collections of workflows and data allowing authors to write whole business solutions and quickly load them into new systems.

> Many of the modules in this course are hands-on. You will get the most benefit by following along with the video or the written instructions.
