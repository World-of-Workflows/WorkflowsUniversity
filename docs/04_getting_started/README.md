# Getting Started / My First Workflow

In this section, we're going to step you through getting started, creating a **Table** and **Data**, Creating a **Workflow** and working with a task.

We're going to start with a customer service example. We're going to configure World of Workflows with a system to manage sales leads. We'll be able to categorize these leads and create a system for follow-up and closing them. 

In addition, we'll create several **views** so you can allow your users to easily navigate the data.

Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

1. [Creating a data structure](./create_data_structure.html) - In this section, we create the structure for the data we are going to use. We commonly create solutions by working with data first.
2. [Adding data](./adding_data.html) - In this section we add data for lead status and add our first lead.
3. [Create Workflow](./create-workflow.html) - In this section, we create a workflow to follow up a lead with a task.
4. [Try it out](./try_it_out.html) - Try out the workflow and see the tasks you created.
