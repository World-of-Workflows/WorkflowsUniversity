# Task Workflows

Creating workflows to work with tasks commonly involves working with the **Task Create** Activity.

This activity takes the following information

- **Title** - This is the title of the task and is the information shown to the user in the task lists. It can be created using plain text, JavaScript or Liquid.
- **Task Description** - This is the description of the task and contains instructions for the user on how to perform the task. It is formatted using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - a simple and easy to use language you can use to format almost any document
