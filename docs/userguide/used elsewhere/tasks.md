# Tasks

The Task Management System in World of Workflows is designed to help users efficiently manage and organize the work assigned to them. *Tasks* are created by *Workflows* and form an important part of the automation of a business process.

This chapter will discuss how to interact with tasks, including picking tasks, understanding task details, updating database fields, and working with action buttons. The creation of tasks within workflows will be covered in a later chapter.

## Overview of the Task Management System

The Task Management System provides the following capabilities:

- View and browse available *Tasks* assigned to you or unassigned.

- **<span class="smallcaps">Pick</span>** a *Task*, adding it to your personal to-do list.

- View *Task* details, including the title, formatted description, and any associated data to enter into the *Task*.

- Update database details directly within a *Task*.

- Complete tasks by clicking action buttons, which correspond to different branches in the workflow.

## Picking tasks

To pick a task and add it to your personal to-do list, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to **<span class="smallcaps">Tasks</span>** in World of Workflows.

2.  On the right hand side, you will see a list of available task..

3.  To pick a task, click on the *Pick* button next to the desired task (or click on the text in the task). The task will now appear in your personal to-do list. This step ensures that no other user will see the *Task* and tells World of Workflows that you are now responsible for completing the *Task*.

## Understanding task details

When you open a task, you will see the following information:

- *Title*: A brief, descriptive title for the task.

- *Description*: A detailed, formatted description providing instructions or context for the task.

- *Fields*: Custom fields associated with the task, which may require input or updates. Not all tasks will have custom fields: this is determined when building the *Workflow* that started the task.

- *Choices*: Buttons allow you to complete the task, or the ability to unassign the task to return it to the queue.

## Updating database fields within tasks

To update the database fields within a task, follow these steps:

1.  Open the *Task* by clicking on its title in your personal to-do list.

2.  Locate the entry field(s) that require input or updates.

3.  Enter or modify the data as necessary.

4.  Click **<span class="smallcaps">Save/Submit</span>** or a similar button, to save your changes and update the database.

## Working with action buttons

*Tasks* may have one or more action *Buttons*, each corresponding to a different branch in the workflow. To complete a task, click on the appropriate action button:

1.  Open the *Task* by clicking on its title in your personal to-do list.

2.  Review the task details and ensure that all required fields have been updated.

3.  Click on the action *Button* that corresponds to the desired outcome or next step in the workflow. This will mark the task as complete and trigger any subsequent actions or tasks in the workflow.

Remember that tasks are created and associated with workflows, which will be covered in more detail in a later chapter. By utilizing the Task Management System in World of Workflows, you can efficiently manage your tasks, collaborate with your team, and ensure smooth progression through your business process as defined in your workflows.
