# Using AI as a Workflow Developer

World of Workflows provides the [OpenAI Plugin](../19_plugins/OpenAIPlugin.html) for use within your workflows to invoke AI functionality in your business processes.  

Whilst World of Workflows is a low code/no code solution, there are many occasions where some JavaScript or Liquid code will improve the functionality.  But what if you are not a strong JavaScript developer?  Never fear: AI is here to help you.

This chapter will take you through some common scenarios, and show you how large language models such as ChatGPT can make you significantly more productive.  The examples here use ChatGPT.  You may be familiar with another LLM: use that instead.

Your fist step is to think of your problem as small, defined steps.  

ChatGPT prompts can include requests to build a web page, or how to fix a single line of JavaScript code, or even ask it how to approach a solution to your problem.
