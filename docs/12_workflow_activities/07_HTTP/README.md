# HTTP

The HTTP activies are simple yet incredibly powerful. They can do everything from calling an external API to developing an entire client front end for your application.

They include the following activities

- [HTTP Endpoint](./01_HTTP-endpoint.html) - This **trigger** fires whenever a specific HTTP endpoint it called
- [HTTP Response](./02_HTTP-response.html) - This respondes to the caller with HTTP
- [Send HTTP Request](./03_Send-HTTP-Request.html) - Sends a request to a HTTP Endpoint
- [Redirect](./04_Redirect.html) - Requests the calling client redirect to a new endpoint
