## Data (ERD) Diagram

An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the tables and relationships within your User Configurable Database. World of Workflows automatically generates an ERD for your database, enabling you to quickly grasp the structure and connections between tables. This visualization is invaluable for understanding the overall data architecture and identifying areas for optimization or expansion.

## Data Dictionary

The data dictionary is a comprehensive reference of all tables and columns within your User Configurable Database. It includes information such as table and column names, data types, descriptions, and any constraints or relationships. World of Workflows generates a data dictionary to facilitate a clear understanding of the database structure and enable efficient management and development of your data.

## Views Dictionary

The views dictionary is a catalog of all the views defined within World of Workflows. It includes information such as view names, descriptions, parent views, and associated fields. The views dictionary aids in managing and understanding the different perspectives and hierarchies of your data, allowing you to create more effective views and improve overall user experience.
