## Editing Data

World of Workflows offers sorting, filtering, inline editing and bulk editing of your data. These features make it incredibly simple to manipulate your data in the system to ensure you have the correct data ready to work with.

Clicking on *Admin* then *Tables* then clicking the name of the Table you want to work with takes you to the data editing screen

This screen allows you to manipulate your data as follows:

## Columns

Columns can be resized and reordered. You can resize columns by hovering over the vertical separator between the column headers, clicking and dragging left and right.

Columns can be re-ordered by editing the order of the column.

Columns can be hidden/shown with the hide/show columns button.

## Sort and Filter

To sort your data by column, click the **^** icon in the column header. When sorted the **^** icon in the column header will be highlighted as shown below:

To filter your data, click the ![Filter Icon](../images/05a_image18.png) icon in any column header. This will bring up the filter window.

Either type into the filter window or click the null or not-null radio buttons to create your filter.

When a column is filtered, the filter button will be shown as highlighted
