**13. Sample Workflows and Case Studies**

This module provides practical examples and case studies to illustrate the implementation of common tasks within the World of Workflows platform. The following sections cover refreshing an access token, sending HTML emails using Office 365, and integrating external APIs into your workflows.

**13.1 Refreshing an Access Token**

Access tokens are essential for authenticating API requests. However, they often have limited lifespans, necessitating a mechanism to refresh them without user intervention.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Store Refresh Token:**
   - Securely store the refresh token obtained during initial authentication.

2. **Create a Workflow to Refresh the Access Token:**
   - Design a workflow that triggers before the access token expires.
   - Use the refresh token to request a new access token from the authentication server.

3. **Update Stored Access Token:**
   - Replace the expired access token with the new one in your secure storage.

For a detailed example, refer to the [Refreshing an Access Token](https://world-of-workflows.github.io/WorkflowsUniversity/docs/22_samples/accessToken.html) section.

**13.2 Sending HTML Emails Using Office 365**

Sending formatted HTML emails enhances communication by allowing rich content. Integrating Office 365 into your workflows enables this functionality.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Set Up Office 365 Connection:**
   - Configure the Office 365 Mail connector within World of Workflows.

2. **Design the Email Content:**
   - Compose the email body using HTML to include desired formatting and elements.

3. **Create a Workflow to Send the Email:**
   - Utilise the Office 365 Mail connector's *Send Email* action.
   - Set the *Message Type* to HTML to ensure proper rendering.

For comprehensive guidance, consult the [Send Email](https://help.okta.com/wf/en-us/Content/Topics/Workflows/connector-reference/office365mail/actions/sendemail2.htm) documentation.

**13.3 Integrating External APIs**

Integrating external APIs allows workflows to interact with various services, expanding their capabilities.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Identify the API Endpoint:**
   - Determine the specific API endpoint and the required HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).

2. **Configure Authentication:**
   - Set up the necessary authentication, such as API keys or OAuth tokens.

3. **Create a Workflow to Call the API:**
   - Use the HTTP activities within World of Workflows to send requests to the API.
   - Handle the API response appropriately, including error handling and data processing.

For a practical example, see the [Using fetch to POST to the server](https://world-of-workflows.github.io/WorkflowsUniversity/docs/22_samples/fetchPost.html) section.

By implementing these sample workflows, you can enhance your automation processes and effectively integrate external services into your World of Workflows environment.
