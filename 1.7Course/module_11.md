# 11. Reporting and Documentation

Effective reporting and documentation are essential for monitoring workflows and maintaining clear records within the World of Workflows platform. This module covers creating and managing reports, automating documentation using OpenAI, and generating API documentation with Swagger.

## 11.1 Generating Reports

World of Workflows offers robust reporting capabilities to help you analyse data and monitor workflow performance.

### 11.1.1 Creating Reports

To create a report:

1. **Access the Reporting Section:**
   - Navigate to *Admin* > *Reports*.

2. **Create a New Report:**
   - Click on *Add Report*.
   - Enter a name and description for the report.

3. **Define Report Criteria:**
   - Select the data type and fields to include.
   - Apply filters to narrow down the data set.

4. **Configure Output Format:**
   - Choose the desired output format (e.g., PDF, Excel).

5. **Save and Run the Report:**
   - Click *Save* to store the report configuration.
   - Click *Run* to generate the report immediately.

For detailed guidance, refer to the [Reporting](https://world-of-workflows.github.io/WorkflowsUniversity/docs/21_reporting/README.html) section.

### 11.1.2 Managing Reports

To manage existing reports:

- **Edit a Report:**
  - Select the report from the list and click *Edit*.
  - Modify the criteria or output settings as needed.

- **Delete a Report:**
  - Select the report and click *Delete*.
  - Confirm the deletion when prompted.

- **Schedule a Report:**
  - Set up a schedule to run the report automatically at specified intervals.

Regularly reviewing and updating reports ensures they remain relevant and accurate.

## 11.2 Automating Documentation

Automating documentation streamlines the process of generating and maintaining workflow documentation. Integrating OpenAI's language models facilitates the creation of comprehensive and coherent documentation.

### 11.2.1 Setting Up OpenAI Integration

To integrate OpenAI with World of Workflows:

1. **Obtain OpenAI API Credentials:**
   - Sign up for an OpenAI account and generate an API key.

2. **Install the OpenAI Plugin:**
   - Download the plugin from the [World of Workflows Extensions](https://www.worldofworkflows.com/extensions-1) page.
   - Navigate to *Admin* > *Plugins* and click *Add Plugin*.
   - Upload the plugin file and follow the installation prompts.

3. **Configure the Plugin:**
   - Go to *Admin* > *Settings* > *OpenAI Plugin*.
   - Enter your API key and configure any additional settings.

For comprehensive instructions, consult the [OpenAI Plugin Documentation](https://world-of-workflows.github.io/WorkflowsUniversity/docs/19_plugins/openai_plugin.html).

### 11.2.2 Generating Documentation

With OpenAI integrated, you can automate the creation of workflow documentation:

1. **Create a Documentation Workflow:**
   - Design a workflow that retrieves workflow definitions and sends them to OpenAI for analysis.

2. **Configure OpenAI Activities:**
   - Use the *Chat Completions* activity to generate descriptive text based on workflow data.

3. **Output the Documentation:**
   - Store the generated text in a document or database for review and distribution.

This approach ensures that documentation is consistently updated and accurately reflects current workflows. For a detailed example, refer to [Automating Documentation with OpenAI](https://world-of-workflows.github.io/WorkflowsUniversity/docs/23_Documentation/automatingDocWithAI.html).

## 11.3 Swagger API Documentation

Swagger is a toolset for generating interactive API documentation, facilitating understanding and utilisation of APIs.

### 11.3.1 Generating Swagger Documentation

To generate Swagger documentation for your workflows:

1. **Install the Swagger Plugin:**
   - Download the plugin from the [World of Workflows Extensions](https://www.worldofworkflows.com/extensions-1) page.
   - Navigate to *Admin* > *Plugins* and click *Add Plugin*.
   - Upload the plugin file and follow the installation prompts.

2. **Access the Swagger UI:**
   - After installation, access the Swagger UI at `https://your-instance-url/swagger`.

3. **Explore the API Endpoints:**
   - The Swagger UI provides a comprehensive overview of available API endpoints, including request and response formats.

For more information, refer to the [Swagger Plugin Documentation](https://world-of-workflows.github.io/WorkflowsUniversity/docs/19_plugins/swagger_plugin.html).

By leveraging these reporting and documentation tools, you can maintain clear, up-to-date records of your workflows and APIs, enhancing transparency and facilitating collaboration within your organisation.
